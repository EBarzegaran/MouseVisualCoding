# MouseVisualCoding
In this repo I will develop my code for mouse visual coding in python.

Here I use a publicly available dataset from Allen Brain institute: https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels

You need to first install Allen SDK: https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html and download the data from there.
